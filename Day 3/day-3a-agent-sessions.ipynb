The trend is towards increasingly sophisticated AI models that can tackle complex biological problems and design entirely new therapeutic entities.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the second key area I mentioned in drug discovery: **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design.** This is a particularly exciting and rapidly evolving aspect of AI in healthcare.\n\nLet me elaborate on this:\n\n**What is Generative AI in Drug Discovery?**\n\nGenerative AI, in this context, refers to AI models that can **create something new** rather than just analyzing or classifying existing data. For drug discovery, this means the AI can **design entirely new chemical structures (molecules)** that have never existed before, with specific desired properties.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n*   **Traditional Drug Discovery:** Scientists would synthesize and test thousands, even millions, of existing or slightly modified compounds to see if they work. It's like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n*   **Generative AI Drug Discovery:** Scientists can tell the AI, \"I need a molecule that will bind strongly to this specific protein (the target), be easily absorbed by the body, and have a low risk of side effects.\" The AI then *generates* a blueprint for such a molecule.\n\n**How Does it Work (Simplified)?**\n\nGenerative AI models learn the underlying patterns and rules of chemistry from vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. Some common types of generative models used include:\n\n1.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Imagine two neural networks: a \"generator\" that creates new molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real molecules and the generated ones. They train each other, with the generator getting better at creating realistic molecules and the discriminator getting better at spotting fakes, leading to highly plausible new molecules.\n2.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecules. They can then sample from this latent space and decode it to generate new molecules.\n3.  **Transformer-based Models (like those used in LLMs):** These models, originally developed for natural language processing, are now being adapted to \"speak the language of chemistry.\" They can learn sequential relationships in molecular structures (e.g., using SMILES strings) and generate novel sequences that represent valid molecules.\n\n**Key Applications and Advancements:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is the most direct application. The AI designs molecules from scratch. This can lead to entirely novel classes of drugs that might not have been conceived through traditional methods.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might propose a molecule with a completely novel scaffold (the core structure) that effectively interacts with a disease target.\n\n*   **Optimization of Existing Leads:** If researchers have a promising but imperfect drug candidate (a \"lead compound\"), generative AI can propose modifications to improve its properties, such as:\n    *   **Increased Potency:** Making it more effective at lower doses.\n    *   **Improved Selectivity:** Ensuring it only binds to the intended target, reducing off-target effects and side effects.\n    *   **Enhanced ADMET Properties:** Improving absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and reducing toxicity.\n\n*   **Exploring Novel Chemical Space:** Traditional drug discovery can sometimes get stuck exploring similar chemical structures. Generative AI can venture into unexplored chemical territories, potentially uncovering drugs with unique mechanisms of action.\n\n*   **Designing Molecules with Multiple Constraints:** The real power comes when AI can design molecules that satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously. For instance, designing a molecule that is potent, selective, non-toxic, orally bioavailable, and easily synthesizable.\n\n**Why is this a Big Deal?**\n\n*   **Speed:** Generative AI can explore millions or billions of potential molecular structures in a fraction of the time it would take traditional methods.\n*   **Efficiency:** It reduces the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and experimentally tested, saving significant time and resources.\n*   **Novelty:** It can uncover completely new chemical entities, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies for diseases that are currently difficult to treat.\n*   **Personalization:** In the future, generative AI could be used to design drugs tailored to an individual patient's genetic makeup or specific disease profile.\n\n**Companies and Their Progress:**\n\nSeveral companies are at the forefront of this. For example, **Insilico Medicine** has been very public about using generative AI to discover new drug candidates, and they've successfully brought AI-designed molecules into clinical trials, which is a major milestone. Other companies are building platforms to offer these generative design capabilities to pharmaceutical and biotech partners.\n\nIn essence, generative AI is shifting drug discovery from an exhaustive search to an intelligent, creative design process, making the journey from identifying a disease target to finding a viable drug candidate much more efficient and innovative.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies using generative AI for novel molecule design in drug discovery is dynamic and growing rapidly.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
